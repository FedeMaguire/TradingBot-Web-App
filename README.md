# Trading Bot and Web Dashboard Overview
# How it Works
This system is a real-time cryptocurrency trading bot developed in Python, integrated with a live web dashboard built using Flask and HTML. It continuously retrieves market data from Binance through its official API, monitors price action and technical indicators, and automatically places trades based on a predefined strategyâ€”specifically, a triple EMA crossover. 
All trading activity, performance metrics, and live analysis are streamed to a Flask-based web app, creating a dynamic and transparent Performance Dashboard.
