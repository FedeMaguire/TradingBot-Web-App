# How it Works
Live Data is gathered fom Binance using Binance API and a Pandas Frame is generated with the last 200 candles.The trading bot triggers a buy order when a specific condition is met and keeps track of the trade until it needs to be closed based on another condition. It does this by checking for a buy signal generated in a pandas DataFrame corresponding to the Stochastic RSI value K-line equal to or above 0.05, and the previous RSI value K-line was below 0.05. If this condition is met, it places a buy limit order. When an order is placed, the code checks for a sell signal in the same pandas DataFrame corresponding to the RSI value K-line equal to or above 0.9, and the previous RSI value K-line was below 0.9. When this condition is met, the order is closed, and the cycle starts over again.

# 
The GUI is coded using the CustomTkinter library to create an easy-to-use environment with clear sections for CHARTS, TRADES, and SETTINGS. LIGHT and DARK modes are available.**Please note that the SETTINGS section is still a work in progress.**
